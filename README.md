## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

This goal of this API is to provide users with a way to manage their finances through budgeting. With functionalities for account creation and login, budget creation, transaction tracking, and tag creation users are able to neatly manage the amounts of money they want to spend in certain categories during certain time periods, all while keeping track of what they have already spent in the past.

## Getting Started

### Usage
 
The iBudgetlyify API is available for free use and is open to developers (through PRs)

#### API Link/URL

The link for the iBudgetlyify API is available at the top right of this GitHub repository and also [HERE](https://ibudgetlyify365.vercel.app)

#### API Documentation

Documentation on the iBudgetlyify API is available [HERE](https://ibudgetlyify365.vercel.app/docs)

### Development

This project is open to outside developers using GitHub's pull request feature. If you plan to contribute, we recommend creation of a local database mimicking the iBudgetlyify database as we will not make any key/.env available for security reasons. You can do that for free through [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
